# fmchallenge_calculator-app

This is a solution for the frontend mentor challenge [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29/hub/calculator-app-lThDuUNsUc]
- I used HTML CSS and JavaScript to implement the design
- It has 3 different themes
- It saves the last set theme to the browser as prefered theme and opens up with the preferred theme when reloaded.
